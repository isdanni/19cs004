# Topology Set up

1. `test_tk.json` and `test_small_batch.json` are directly taken from [spider-docker](https://github.com/yangl1996/spider-docker/tree/master/topology).
2. `node*.json` are specified in the node numbers.
3. `test1.txt` includes a different input format.
4. `hotnets.json` is used to test edge cases including elephant(extremely large) transaction, max amout of nodes in a single network, and frequent transactions between two parties.
5. `test_small_batch.json` includes a single test setup that is used for connection channel test.
